Countries are classified into “red”, “yellow” and “green” categories, based on the severity of the COVID situation in each.Hungarian citizens and their relatives can enter Hungary from a “green” country without a health check. A Hungarian citizen coming from a “yellow” or “red” country will be subjected to health checks at the border and must be quarantined for 14 days. An exception to this is if they can credibly show two negative coronavirus tests 48 hours apart in the previous 5 days. A Hungarian citizen coming from a “yellow” country may be released from quarantine after the first negative coronavirus test, but if coming from a “red” country, two negative tests are required.In the case of non-Hungarian citizens, those coming from a “yellow” country can enter under the same conditions as Hungarian citizens, but it is not possible to enter Hungary from a “red” country.Categories and countries (as of August 5, 2020):“Red” Countries:Republic of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Belarus, Republic of Kosovo, Republic of Northern Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Ukraine, all African countries, all Asian countries, except for Japan, the People’s Republic of China, and South Korea, all countries belonging to the Australian continent, and most countries on the American continent.“Yellow” Countries:Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Norway, Russian Federation, Romania, Republic of Serbia, Kingdom of Sweden, Japan, People’s Republic of China, United States of America, Canada, and Spain.“Green” Countries:Countries that did not receive a yellow or red classification are green.The Government of Hungary will regularly review the classification of countries, and will adjust it to possible changes in the COVID situation.Transit and freight traffic are exempt but will have to follow an officially designated corridor. At the same time, health examinations may be carried out if needed.See details with a map of Europe here (as of July 13, 2020): http://abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/government-introduces-new-international-travel-restrictions/Information about testing requirements: http://abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/chief-medical-officer-is-continuously-monitoring-epidemic-situation-abroad-as-well/Official list of countries by category (as of August 5, 2020):  https://magyarkozlony.hu/dokumentumok/1738d89faf98120575e675ba8d1f7206d96f6cb9/megtekintes (PDF 623KB) (in Hungarian)Humanitarian corridors: Foreign citizens arriving from abroad in passenger traffic to transit can enter Hungary if they undergo a medical check upon entry and such a check does not reveal the suspicion of infection.
