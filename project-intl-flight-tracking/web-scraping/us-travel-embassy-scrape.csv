Azerbaijan,"As of August 9,Azerbaijan has confirmed 33568 cases of COVID-19 within its borders. There have been 490 confirmed deaths.All of Azerbaijan’s borders are currently closed to passenger traffic.Flights into and out of Azerbaijan are no longer available.All arrivals to Azerbaijan, including U.S. citizens, are currently being placed in a mandatory 14-day quarantine in government-provided facilities, regardless of travel origin.— We have received reports of families being separated in these facilities, and persons being required to share rooms with others.— The quality of basic services in these facilities varies, and may not meet all travelers’ individual needs.— These quarantine measures are subject to change without prior notice.The Government of Azerbaijan has extended rules restricting international passenger traffic and movement in the regions of Baku, Sumgayit, Ganja, Lankaran, Absheron, and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic through August 1, 2020.The Government of Azerbaijan has implemented strict rules requiring people to stay inside, whether in private homes, apartments, or permanent or temporary residences and to monitor citizen movements. From June 22 to July 5, 2020, the Government of Azerbaijan will reintroduce an SMS regime requiring individuals in Baku, Ganja, Sumgayit, Lankaran, Yevlakh, Masalli, Lankaran, Jalilabad, and Absheron to obtain permission by SMS to leave home for essential trips. Individuals must send 1 to leave home for medical care, 2 for trips to the grocery store, pharmacy, bank, post office, or time outdoors, and 3 to attend funerals. Foreigners temporarily staying in Azerbaijan can obtain an identification number from the State Migration Service (SMS) online. Foreigners must then text the number indicating the reason for their departure from home plus either their temporary or permanent residence number (e.g. MYI/DYI 11111111) or the identification number provided online by the SMS to the number 8103. For example, if a person with a temporary residence permit would like to leave the house to buy groceries, to buy medicine, or to visit the bank or post office, he or she would text “2 MYI 11111111” to 8103. A text granting permission will come within one hour. Individuals are allowed to be away from home for two hours when using code “1” or “2”.Police will then verify this information when conducting checks on the street. Fines or jail terms can be imposed for violators of these rules. For assistance to resolve technical difficulties or if you do not receive permission within one hour, call the ASAN Service call center at 9108.After July 5, restrictions will remain partially eased for all regions of Azerbaijan except for Baku, Sumgayit, Ganja, Lankaran, Absheron, and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.

Those currently in China should attempt to depart by commercial means.The Chinese government continues to take steps to try to control the spread of the virus, including mandatory quarantine for U.S. citizens entering China (see below). Additional steps may vary from place to place and travelers should inquire with local authorities on specific policies before traveling within China. Travelers should be prepared for the possibility of travel restrictions and quarantine fees with little or no advance notice. U.S. citizens should also be aware of local public health requirements. Remember that while in China, U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of China.The U.S. Embassy in Beijing continues to closely monitor developments related to COVID-19 in the PRC.","Effective since March 28, 2020, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) suspended entry into the PRC by foreign nationals holding visas or residence permits. Entry by foreign nationals with APEC Business Travel Cards was suspended as well.

Foreign nationals coming to China for necessary economic, trade, scientific or technological activities or out of emergency humanitarian needs may apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates cannot forecast when these policies will be lifted or amended.U.S. citizens should continue to expect a significant reduction in flights to and from China. Effective since March 29, 2020, Chinese aviation authorities require foreign airlines to maintain only one air route to China and operate no more than one flight per week. Chinese domestic airlines have also reduced available routes per guidelines. Flights to and from China should carry no more than 75 percent of the passengers that they are licensed to carry. U.S. citizens planning to depart China should continue to expect a significant drop in the number of options and frequency of flights to the United States and should plan accordingly.All international flights into Beijing have been rerouted to regional airports for screening and quarantine, which is mandatory for U.S. citizens entering China (see below). Other airports in China may have different procedures, which may change without notice. These procedures are not being implemented in a uniform manner. Travelers should reach out to airlines or local authorities on specific policies and should be prepared for potentially long delays when entering and exiting China.U.S. citizens intending to return to the United States should continue to seek commercially available flights. Travelers should directly contact local airlines for more information. Please understand that flight delays and cancellations are still frequent; the U.S. Embassy and Consulates hold no discretion over these decisions.In the event thatthe situation further deteriorates, the ability of the U.S. Embassy and Consulatesto provide assistance to U.S. nationals within China may be limited. The United States is not offering additional chartered evacuation flights from China at this time.Chinese authorities maintain travel restrictions in the area around Wuhan. Travelers should be aware that the Chinese government could prevent them from entering or exiting parts of Hubei province. Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Hubei province.All Chinese visa related questions should be directed to the local Chinese Exit-Entry Bureau (EEB).","All travelers, including U.S. citizens who enter China, are screened upon arrival and subject to a 14-day quarantine. While restrictions around domestic travel within China have eased, local quarantine requirements can vary significantly between cities, and regulations can change very quickly. All international arrivals should be prepared to complete quarantine at a government-selected facility or hotel at their own expense, with no control over the amenities, even if they maintain a residence in China. Cities and provinces within China may also require quarantine for domestic travelers, regardless of nationality. U.S. citizens may also be required to install and use location tracking software on their phones in order to access public spaces and some businesses. Some private hospitals may refuse admittance to travelers who have been in the United States 14 days prior to entering China.Please consult local authorities on specific quarantine requirements.It is unlikely that local authorities will notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulate of your quarantine. If you are placed into quarantine, contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate with your name, passport number, and location.We strongly urge U.S. citizens remaining in China to limit contact with others, including large gatherings, and to abide by local health and safety guidelines.

the Kingdom of Denmark,":— The Kingdom of Denmark has confirmed cases of COVID-19 within its borders, including Greenland and the Faroe Islands.— Flights to the U.S. are available via commercial carrier.SAS Airlinesresumed nonstop flights from Copenhagen to Chicago, New York, and San Francisco, with each route operating twice per week. If you have a SAS airline ticket for summer travel to other U.S. destinations, do not assume the flight is guaranteed. Check with SAS to see if your flight is confirmed.FromKastrup Airportthere are multiple flights per week on various air carriers to other European hubs from which you can board a U.S.-bound flight. The most common hubs are Amsterdam, London, Frankfurt, and Paris. Flight routes from Kastrup Airport are being added or modified frequently. Book tickets directly with your airline. Check with your airline directly to see if your flight is confirmed.","Denmark: The Danish border closure – imposed on March 14 – remains in place for tourism-related travel from the United States. There is no definitive date when travelers from the United States will be permitted to enter Denmark for tourism. The ban does not apply to most travelers resident in the EU, Schengen Zone, and the United Kingdom; these travelers are permitted to enter Denmark for tourism if they have a lodging reservation in Denmark for six nights or longer. The entry ban does not apply to foreigners who have valid Danish work or residency permits, foreign spouses, foreign parents, or foreign children of Danish citizens and residents, and those the Danish government determines have a “worthy purpose” of travel.  The full list of border closure exceptions and most up-to-date information can be found on the Danish government COVID-19 information page.Exceptions to the Danish border closures change frequently, often with little to no notice. A full list of exceptions to the Danish border closure requirements can be found on the Danish government COVID-19 information page. Contact the Danish National Police hotline number for advice about whether or not your purpose of travel is permissible. The hotline is open weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. local and weekends and holidays from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. local at: +45 7020 6044.Border closures will impact a significant number of train, air, and ferry routes, including cruise ship traffic.Travel to Denmark Under Danish “Sweetheart Declaration” Exception: The Danish government permits “sweethearts”, fiancees, and other close relations of Danish citizens or foreign nationals legally residing in Denmark to enter Denmark, so long as the individual can present proof of a negative COVID-19 test carried out no more than 72 hours before entry. This exception is Denmark-specific and does not apply to all countries within the Schengen zone or EU. If you are traveling to Denmark under the “sweetheart declaration” you are strongly encouraged to take a nonstop flight from the United States to Denmark to ensure smooth entry into the country. U.S. citizens have been denied entry into the Schengen Area/EU when attempting to transit a third country in Europe en route to Denmark for this purpose of travel. Many Schengen Area ports of entry are strictly enforcing the European Union travel restrictions on non-essential travel from outside the EU, which does not include “sweetheart” travelers from the United States. To avoid issues at the port of entry, take a nonstop flight from the United States to Denmark for this purpose of travel. Detailed instructions on what you must present to the Danish border authorities when seeking entry for this purpose of travel can be found on the Danish government COVID-19 information page (available in English). Schengen Visa Overstays: Danish authorities announced new procedures for foreign citizens who have overstayed their authorized period of stay in Denmark due to COVID-19 related travel disruptions. Effective March 23,when a foreign citizen is departing Denmark the Danish Border Police will assess the reason for the overstay (if applicable). If the Danish authorities determine the overstay was the result of COVID-19 they will issue a letter to the person confirming that the date of departure from Denmark has been postponed by 60 days. This determination will only be made at the time of departure from Denmark. You should not go to a Danish police station seeking an assessment and/or letter in advance of your departure date. Full information can be found on theDanish Immigration Services website.Greenland: The Government of Greenland maintains a COVID-19 information page with up-to-date entry requirements (available in English). Travelers from “open countries” – as classified by Denmark – may travel to Greenland if they present a negative COVID-19 test result taken in a Nordic country (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, or the Faroe Islands) no more than five days prior to travel. Open countries include mostly other Nordic countries and the Schengen Area. A travel ban remains in place for travelers from other countries – including the United States – unless the traveler has a “worthy” purpose of travel as classified by Denmark; such travelers must quarantine upon arrival. The full list of travel exceptions (ie, worthy purposes) can be found on the Danish government COVID-19 information page (available in English). All travelers to Greenland must also complete a “Sumut” form prior to entry, which contains your itinerary and lodging details in Greenland. That form can be found on theGreenlandic government COVID-19 information page.The Greenlandic National Medical Office has additional information about COVID-19 in Greenland (available in English). You can also call the Greenlandic COVID-19 Travel and Visitation Group for specific questions about travel to or within Greenland at +299 80 11 00.","Anyone coming to Denmark from a country or region where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs advises against all non-essential travel due to COVID-19 – which includes the United States – is strongly advised to stay home for 14 days after arriving in Denmark. An up-to-date list of countries the Danish authorities consider “open” or “banned” for travel can be found on the Danish government COVID-19 information page. Additional information about quarantine requirements in Denmark can be found on the Danish government COVID-19 information page.If you are exhibiting flu-like symptoms and believe you have COVID-19 do not go to an emergency room, your doctor’s office, or the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen. Call your doctor or the Danish COVID-19 hotline number at +45 70 20 02 33.

Djibouti,":More than 5,000 cases of COVID-19 and 59 fatalities have been confirmed by authorities in Djibouti to date.After successive weeks of improvement, the COVID-19 situation in Djibouti has worsened with numbers of active cases returning to their mid-July levels. The increase stems mainly from people testing positive at border crossings.On July 17, 2020, Djibouti’s Ambouli International Airport opened for incoming and outgoing passenger traffic. Air Djibouti, Air France, Ethiopian Airlines, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have all resumed flights in and out of Djibouti.Passenger service on the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railroad remains suspended.Restaurants are currently open, while nightclubs, bars and movie theaters are scheduled to reopen on September 1st.","On 16 July, the Ministry of Health issued a circular note on the reopening of borders, specifying the health protocols for passengers. Travelers coming to Djibouti by air/sea/land must be screened for COVID-19 upon arrival at ports of entry. In addition, travelers coming to Djibouti must be equipped with protective masks at the time of departure or arrival at the points of entry, respect the physical distance of one meter, if possible, at all stages of the journey and carry a hydro-alcoholic gel throughout the trip.Upon arrival at Ambouli International Airport, all passengers are tested for COVID-19 using a minimally invasive saliva test. Travelers identified with the virus either go into isolation and treatment or depart Djibouti on the next flight without leaving the airport.Some destinations beyond Djibouti require a negative COVID-19 test certificate for entry. The only facility in Djibouti offering these tests is Bouffard Hospital, charging $30 per test. Airlines may require passengers heading to these destinations to show a negative COVID-19 test certificate before allowing them to board their flight.American Citizen Services and Visa Services:Due to the global and local impact of COVID-19, the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti suspended all routine consular services on March 15, 2020. The Embassy continues to operate on reduced staffing due to COVID-19. We are unable to provide an estimate on when the embassy will resume normal operations. While the U.S. Department of State is beginning to resume a very limited number of routine visa and passport services, all visa and passport applicants should anticipate a several months wait before the embassy resumes full consular operations.We encourage U.S. citizens in need of passport services or assistance to contact the Embassy’s American Citizen Services Unit atDjiboutiACS@state.gov.For questions involving immigrant visa cases, please contactConsularDjibouti@state.gov.Other Links:COVID-19 crisis page on travel.state.govCountry Information and Travel Advisory pageCDC Djibouti Travel Page COVID-19 – Visa Services and RestrictionsBy U.S. Embassy Djibouti | 6 August, 2020 | Topics: Alert, U.S. Citizen Services | Tags: COVID-19Suggested for YouDjibouti Travel Advisory- Level 3: Reconsider TravelMessage for U.S. Citizens:  U.S. Embassy Djibouti",,"['coronavirus.gov: https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcoronavirus.gov%2F&data=02%7C01%7CODriscollKM%40state.gov%7C12b94686dede4606faa308d83a014974%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637323124481414017&sdata=ADNX1SjjT%2BArobqwmzSRkxK0YOP5f3d1BjhPiYqiRZU%3D&reserved=0', 'DjiboutiACS@state.gov: mailto:DjiboutiACS@state.gov', 'ConsularDjibouti@state.gov: mailto:ConsularDjibouti@state.gov', 'COVID-19 crisis page on travel.state.gov: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html', 'Country Information and Travel Advisory page: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Djibouti.html', 'CDC Djibouti Travel Page : https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/djibouti', 'COVID-19 – Visa Services and Restrictions: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-visa-services-and-restrictions.html', 'U.S. Embassy Djibouti: https://dj.usembassy.gov/author/usembassydjibouti/', 'Alert: https://dj.usembassy.gov/category/alert/', 'U.S. Citizen Services: https://dj.usembassy.gov/category/us-citizen-services/', 'COVID-19: https://dj.usembassy.gov/tag/covid-19/', ': https://dj.usembassy.gov/djibouti-travel-advisory-level-3-reconsider-travel/', 'Djibouti Travel Advisory- Level 3: Reconsider Travel: https://dj.usembassy.gov/djibouti-travel-advisory-level-3-reconsider-travel/', ': https://dj.usembassy.gov/message-for-u-s-citizens-u-s-embassy-djibouti-july-30-2020/', 'Message for U.S. Citizens:  U.S. Embassy Djibouti: https://dj.usembassy.gov/message-for-u-s-citizens-u-s-embassy-djibouti-july-30-2020/']",,

What should I do?A: The Migration Service of Kazakhstan has announced that foreigners currently in the country either visa-free or on an expired visa have until August 5, 2020 to leave the country or renew their visa without penalty. Due to potential increased demand for such services, U.S. citizens are urged to renew lapsed visas as soon as possible. For additional information, see the website of Kazakhstani Embassy in the United States. Those in country on work visas should also work through their employers. Migration violations will be prosecuted starting August 5, 2020, and we urge you to obtain an exit visa to leave Kazakhstan as quickly as possible. Migration Police offices have reopened; for additional information, see their Facebook page.Q: Will I have issues at the airport when departing Kazakhstan if my visa expired during the state of emergency?A: Foreign citizens in this situation will be able to depart Kazakhstan by August 5, 2020 without penalty. Those leaving the country should contact their local Migration Police office as soon as possible to obtain an exit visa.Q: Can foreigners travel to or reenter Kazakhstan?A: Our current understanding is that borders largely remain closed to foreigners with limited exception, and we note that visa-free travel to Kazakhstan for U.S. citizens has been suspended until November 2020. Please note that immigration questions are the purview of the Government of Kazakhstan, and we are not permitted to give recommendations or intervene on matters related to entering Kazakhstan. Such matters should be directed to the Kazakhstani Embassy in the United States or, if applicable, your employer. Note that visa-free travel to Kazakhstan has been suspended until November 2020.Q: If I am eligible to enter Kazakhstan, what restrictions are in place?A: Those granted entry to Kazakhstan from abroad via air travel must provide a PCR test documenting their negative status for COVID-19 and dated no more than five days prior to their entry to Kazakhstan. Those who do not provide such a test will be held in quarantine for up to two days and tested for COVID-19 at that time. Individuals either displaying symptoms of COVID-19 or who test positive for COVID-19 may be hospitalized. Those who test negative will be released after the two days of monitored quarantine and allowed to self-isolate from home for 12 days. Individuals in self-isolation at home may be required to download the Smart Astana app, which will be used to monitor compliance with self-isolation restrictions.Q: Do you have any information on when Kazakhstan will start issuing visasagain, both inside the country and at its embassies?A: Most Migration Police offices have reopened in Kazakhstan. The Consular Sections of the Kazakhstani Embassy and Consulates in the United States reopened June 15, 2020. Please note that immigration questions are the purview of the Government of Kazakhstan, and we are not permitted to give recommendations or intervene on matters related to entering Kazakhstan. Such matters should be directed to the Kazakhstani Embassy in the United States.Q: Can I travel to Kazakhstan without a visa?A: On April 17, the Government of Kazakhstan suspended a previous decree that had allowed citizens of the United States, in addition to some other countries, to enter and stay in Kazakhstan for 30 days visa-free. U.S. citizens seeking entry or reentry to Kazakhstan prior to November 1, 2020 will require a valid visa. Those applying for a visa will be required to submit a medical certificate — dated no more than 48 hours prior to the date of application — confirming they are not infected with COVID-19. For additional information, see the website of the Kazakhstani Embassy in the United States.Q: I saw that I need to provide COVID-19 negative test results to get a Kazakhstani visa. How can I get a COVID-19 test in the United States?A: Contact your health provider or local health department in the United States for information on how to get tested. For entry to Kazakhstan, please note that Kazakhstan requires a PCR test.Q: Since visas are obtained often a week or more before departure, will Kazakhstan require a second test in order to get on a flight to enter the country?A: The Kazakhstani government has not announced any requirement to get a second COVID test in order to board an international flight to the country. However, passengers with a certificate of negative PCR test results issued not earlier than 5 days before arrival will not be subject to COVID-19 testing on arrival. Passengers without a negative PCR test result will be screened for COVID-19 upon arrival in Kazakhstan and held in quarantine for up to two days.Travel ConcernsQ: I booked a flight out of a different city of Kazakhstan. Will I be able to travel for my flight?A: As of 1 June, Kazakhstani authorities have removed checkpoints and vehicular barriers between most cities and regions; however, authorities have reinstalled checkpoints in Kokshetau and Karaganda Oblast. The situation may change with little or no notice, and residents should note that additional checkpoints or quarantine measures could take effect at any time. If checkpoints have been installed in your region and you require access to an airport to leave the country, contact USAKZ@state.gov at least 5 working days before your scheduled flight.U.S. Citizens Arriving in the United StatesQ: What happens after I arrive in the United States? What are the testing and quarantine requirements?A: We recommend you visit Coronavirus.gov, which covers this issue in detail in the Frequently Asked Questions section. The requirements vary depending on which country or region you have been present in. There are no entry restrictions for U.S. citizens or their immediate family members, or permanent residents. Anyone in those categories can travel to and enter the United States. “Immediate family members” includes the spouse, minor children, or parent of a minor U.S. citizen, regardless of nationality. “Permanent residents” are those who already have received a permanent resident card, commonly known as a green card. Those who have an immigrant visa (including the Diversity Visa) but have not yet traveled to the United State not exempt from the travel restrictions.Absentee VotingQ: How can I mail my vote from Kazakhstan?A: Although the global pandemic has disrupted regular mail service between Kazakhstan and the United States, international courier services such as DHL are still operating.Q: Can the Embassy/Consulate mail my ballot back to the United States for me?A: American citizens are welcome to bring their ballots to the U.S. Embassy in Nur-Sultan or the Consulate General in Almaty to be sent to the United States via diplomatic pouch. Once diplomatic pouch shipments arrive in Washington, D.C., these ballots will be sorted by State Department personnel and sent to their respective destinations via the United States Postal Service. Please note, however, that in light of obstacles posed by the global pandemic, diplomatic pouch shipments have been subject to unpredictable and often long delays, and the U.S. Mission cannot guarantee timely arrival of ballots submitted by U.S. citizens overseas. We recommend submitting your FPCA as soon as possible, and mailing ballots no later than October 2. U.S. citizens who wish to send their ballots via diplomatic pouch should contact the Embassy or Consulate General using the contact information below in order to schedule an appointment. Please note that all visitors to the Embassy and Consulate General are subject to security screening and you will not be permitted to bring electronic devices, including cell phones, inside the facility.Q: Why can’t everyone just vote online?A: Each state has its own requirements for absentee voting. Some allow ballots to be returned electronically, others restrict it to certain categories such as military families overseas, and others only accept physical ballots by traditional mail. We encourage you to reach out to your local voting precinct to explain your situation and ask if electronic voting is an option.Visa ServicesQ: When will the embassy and consulate resume visa services?A: The Department of State suspended routine visa services at all embassies and consulates in March in order for staff to focus on assisting U.S. citizens, which is always our top priority. The Department will decide on a country by country basis when to resume visa processing. This will take many factors into account, including the needs of the local U.S. citizen community, the amount of staff available, the local health situation and movement restrictions. We continue to provide emergency visa services for certain categories of applicants, so please reach out if you feel you have an urgent travel need.Q: Can my visa be extended if I couldn’t travel due to the suspension of international flights?A: Visas cannot be extended, but those with expired or soon to expire visas may apply for a new visa, provided they are still qualified. Anyone with an expiring immigrant visa can contact us at USAKZ@state.gov for information about how to apply for a new visa once normal visa services resume, based on the particulars of your case.Q: I had an interview for a Diversity Visa before the Presidential Proclamation suspending the entry of immigrants came into effect, but my case required additional administrative processing. Are we subject to the suspension of entry?A: If your Diversity Visa was not approved and issued before the date that the Presidential Proclamation came into effect on April 23, you are subject to the terms of the proclamation. That means we cannot issue your visa, nor can you immigrate to the United States.Actions to Take: Monitor local government websites for updates.

Morocco,,")The Government of Morocco has extended the country’s “Health State of Emergency” untilSeptember 10as part of its emergency measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. The country continues its phased deconfinement strategy, classifying each region as Zone 1 (less restricted movements and activities) or Zone 2 (greater restrictions on movements and activities). U.S. citizens should monitor social media and local press reports for more information regarding specific location/zones of travel in Morocco and be aware that travel and other restrictions may change with little notice. Ensure you are familiar with local requirements prior to travel between regions and remember to follow the instructions of local authorities.On July 27, the Government of Morocco announced that domestic travel is prohibited until further notice to/from the following cities: Berrechid, Casablanca, Fes, Marrakech, Meknes, Settat, Tangier, and Tetouan. Those needing to travel to an airport for a special operation flight, or to/from one of these cities for medical or work reasons, must receive a travel authorization letter from the local authorities. In addition to domestic travel for health, work, or board a special operation flight, Moroccan authorities have indicated that a hotel reservation in another city is sufficient reason to obtain a travel authorization.All regularly scheduled commercial flights to/from Morocco remain suspended, as doferries to/from Spain. The borders with Ceuta and Melilla remain closed.Special operation flights to/from Morocco are taking place on Royal Air Maroc (RAM) and Air Arabia.RAM is operating a direct flight from Casablanca to New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK).Special operation ferries are taking place to/from Morocco and Sète, France and Genoa, Italy. Additionally, Air France will be operating flights from August 3-10 between select Moroccan cities (Marrakech, Casablanca, Rabat, Oujda, Agadir, Fes, and Nador) and Paris, Nantes, and Lyon.U.S. passport holdersare not allowed to enter the European Union unless they qualify for an exception under European rules – no matter how long they have been in Morocco. Americans traveling back to the United States will likely be permitted to transit a European airport, however as long as the European travel restrictions remain in place, U.S. citizens will not likely be permitted to leave the airport. Travelers with additional questions about European entry rules should contact the embassies or the border control authorities of the European country they wish to visit and/or review information on U.S. embassy webpages in the transit countries.U.S. Embassy Paris:  https://fr.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/U.S. Embassy Madrid:  https://es.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/U.S. Embassy London:  https://uk.usembassy.gov/covid-19-coronavirus-information/U.S. Embassy Rome:  https://it.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/ U.S. Embassy Lisbon:  https://pt.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/Because limited commercial flight options now exist for U.S. citizens, the U.S. Consulate General does not anticipate arranging further repatriation flights. Foreign citizens in the country without a visa who were unable to depart Morocco within the normal 90-day limit will be permitted to exit without a fine until at least August 10. The government has not announced whether foreign citizens will be able to continue to depart without a fine after August 10.There is no requirement for COVID-19 testing in order to depart Morocco. However, travelers should verify the testing requirements of their travel destination. The United States is not currently requiring COVID-19 testing in order to enter. Monitor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for additional information:  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html.The only U.S. citizens who can return to Morocco at this time are those who are legal residents of Morocco. The Government of Morocco has not announced when it will allow non-residents or tourists to enter the country. U.S. citizens, who are also legal residents of Morocco, who intend to return to Morocco under the Moroccan special operation must undergo COVID-19 testing before departure. They must show a negative PCR test dated within 48 hours of departure and a serological test.Routine Visa Services Remain SuspendedThe U.S. Consulate General is not currently processing any routine visa applications. We will resume routine visa services as soon as possible but are unable to provide a specific date at this time.Beginning July 21, the Consulate General began issuing replacement immigrant visas to individuals who were unable to travel to the United States (due to the Health State of Emergency) prior to the expiration of their visa.

This cancellation does not preclude a traveler from re-applying for an ESTA after the cessation of the travel moratorium.

South Korea,"Authorities have confirmed that community-based transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in Korea. U.S. Embassy Seoul continues to closely monitor developments.The U.S. Department of State currently has a level 3 travel advisory (Reconsider Travel) for South Korea. Please see the full language of the travel advisory here.Despite reductions in flight services by several carriers, South Korea remains well-served by commercial aviation. Please see   https://www.airport.kr/ap/en/index.do to check departure schedules and flight availability.","June 1, 2020: Foreigners who are long-term residents of the Republic of Korea (ROK) will be required to obtain a re-entry permit prior to departing for international travel. The permits are available atimmigration offices,airports, and port offices. The cost is 30,000 won and the re-entry permit is valid for one year. Failure to apply for a re-entry permit prior to departure will result in the cancellation of the traveler’s ROK Alien Registration. Foreign long-term residents of the ROK will also be required to provide a medical certificate or negative COVID-19 test before boarding flights to Korea. The certificate must be in English or Korean and signed by a medical professional within 48 hours of departure; it should include information about fever, cough,and other potential symptoms.While a negative COVID-19 test result is accepted for immigration, it is not a requirement for the medical certificate.Diplomats (A-1), Government Officials (A-2, A-3) or Overseas Korean (F-4) status do not need to apply for re-entry permits or provide medical certificates when returning to Korea.IMPORTANT UPDATE FOR U.S. TRAVELERS TO SOUTH KOREA:Effective as ofApril 1st, the Republic of Korea’sMinistry of Health and Welfare (MOHW)imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for ALL inbound passengers. Most foreign travelers on short-term travel will be required to quarantine at a government-designated facility at their own expense for 14 days (this includes U.S. citizens traveling on 90-day visa free travel and short-term visa holders). The nightly cost at these facilities could range from $100 to $150 USD per night (approximately $1,400-$2,100 USD total) depending on various factors, and prices are set by the Korean authorities. Passengers that fall into this category will be required to sign a release form from the ROK agreeing to these conditions prior to boarding the plane. If the passenger refuses to sign the form, they will be denied boarding. Details about the quarantine process and a copy of the release form are available on the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in the USAwebsite.In some cases, Korean authorities have permitted immediate blood relatives or spouses of long-term residents to self-quarantine at their family’s home. Please bring proof of relationship (e.g., marriage or birth certificate) with you but understand that Korean immigration officials have the final authority to approve quarantine arrangements.Travelers who are long-term or residential visa holders will be required to self-quarantine at their own residences and must undergo a COVID test within three days. All passengers who exhibit symptoms will be required to undergo COVID-19 testing on arrival at the airport and may be subject to additional procedures. Some U.S. citizens traveling to South Korea for business or academic reasons or because of the death of a family member may be exempt from self-quarantine requirements. Isolation exemption certificates must be approved prior to travel at a Korean Embassy or Consulate in the United States.Korean health authorities have indicated that all passengers will be required to download and respond to daily questions via aSelf-Diagnosis Mobile Appfor 14 days. Those who violate the self-quarantine order may be subject to a fine, arrest, or deportation. Passengers who are unable to download the mobile app must provide a valid phone number and address in Korea to facilitate daily health monitoring by local government officials.Most passengers transiting through Korean airports (who do not pass through immigration) have no quarantine requirement for stays less than 24 hours. However, transit passengers may need to undergo temperature checks or fill out health questionnaires.As the State Department has already advised U.S. citizens to reconsider travel to Korea due to COVID-19, please take these new screening procedures into account before you decide to continue with your travel plans.All travelers to Korea should be aware that COVID-19 screening measures are subject to change with little advance notice. Please consult the ROK COVID-19 portal forthe most up-to-date information on special immigration procedures before your travels.Travelers departing Korea for the United States or other destinations may be required to undergo temperature screening or complete health questionnaires. We recommend that you check with your airline prior to travel to confirm current procedures.","If you are currently in Korea and believe that you may have symptoms of COVID-19, please call the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) treatment hotline at 1339 or 1345 (English) to be directed to an appropriate facility.","['https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html', 'here: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/south-korea-travel-advisory.html', 'https://www.airport.kr/ap/en/index.do: https://www.airport.kr/ap/en/index.do', 'immigration offices: https://www.hikorea.go.kr/Main.pt', 'airports: https://www.airport.kr/ap/en/index.do', 'Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW): https://www.mohw.go.kr/eng/', 'website: http://overseas.mofa.go.kr/us-en/brd/m_4500/list.do', 'Korean Embassy or Consulate in the United States: http://overseas.mofa.go.kr/us-en/index.do', 'Self-Diagnosis Mobile App: http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/selfcheck/', 'ROK COVID-19 portal: http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/baroView.do?brdId=11&brdGubun=111', 'ROK COVID-19 Portal: http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/', 'Korean Immigration Service: http://immigration.go.kr/immigration_eng/index.do', 'U.S. Forces Korea website: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGuEFlo_sOzBtLRiybx0NzNO9H2Cl-pvEGPVniPJeic5kWFw/viewform?entry.475633222=%2B82-10&entry.1915364745=USFK', 'Embassy of the Republic of Korea in the USA: http://overseas.mofa.go.kr/us-en/brd/m_4500/list.do', 'Consular Alerts & Messages: https://kr.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/', 'COVID-19 crisis page on travel.state.gov: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/novel-coronavirus-hubei-province--china.html', 'CDC page on COVID-19: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/covid-19-south-korea', 'Travel.state.gov Republic of Korea Information and Travel Advisory page: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SouthKorea.html', 'U.S. Mission Korea: https://kr.usembassy.gov/author/usembassyseoul/', 'Alert: https://kr.usembassy.gov/category/alert/', 'Messages for U.S. Citizens: https://kr.usembassy.gov/category/messages-for-us-citizens/', 'News: https://kr.usembassy.gov/category/news/', ': https://kr.usembassy.gov/080720-secretary-pompeos-call-with-partners-on-covid-19/', 'Secretary Pompeo’s Call with Partners on COVID-19: https://kr.usembassy.gov/080720-secretary-pompeos-call-with-partners-on-covid-19/', ': https://kr.usembassy.gov/080720-u-s-embassy-hosts-u-s-virtual-community-college-fair/', 'U.S. Embassy Hosts U.S. Virtual Community College Fair: https://kr.usembassy.gov/080720-u-s-embassy-hosts-u-s-virtual-community-college-fair/']",,

Travelers should present proof of their reservations as requested and/or during check-in with airlinesAll travelers must carry with them a completed Air Passenger Travel Form and a copy of their passport. This form may be presented during check-in with airlinesThere are multiple commercial air options for U.S. citizens who wish to depart Papua New Guinea en route to the United States. These routes may also facilitate travel from the United States to Papua New Guinea. At present, all options route through Brisbane, Australia. Air Niuginiis the only carrier operating regular commercial service between Port Moresby and Brisbane. U.S. citizens should carefully review requirements fortransiting Australia.Domestic travel within Australia, even to connect with onward international flights, is not advisable.From Brisbane, the following carriers are currently operating commercial air service viable for travel between Papua New Guinea and the United States.Air New Zealand– Brisbane to Auckland and Auckland to Los Angeles.Qatar Airways – Brisbane to Doha nonstop and Doha to multiple destinations in the United States.Emirates– Brisbane to Dubai nonstop and Dubai to multiple destinations in the United States.U.S. citizens transiting Auckland must have a validNew Zealand Electronic Travel Authority(NZeTA), must have no more than 24 hours transit time in Auckland, and must not leave the airport. U.S. citizens should carefully review requirements fortransiting New Zealand.On July 13th, the Australian government implemented a cap on the number of international passengers arriving at Brisbane Airport per week. Under the cap, all airlines operating international flights en route to Brisbane imposed a limit of 30 passengers per flight. However, passengers transiting Australia en route to a third country are not counted toward the caps. Accordingly, U.S. citizens en route to Brisbane should inform their airline well before check-in of any onward itinerary and verify that their reservations are still viable.For all routes, U.S. citizens should look for options that minimize transit time in Brisbane to the greatest extent possible. Transit times of more than eight hours require a valid Australian transit visaorElectronic Travel Authority (new ETA applications are not being processed) and also require quarantine for the duration of transit, as directed by local authorities, generally at a nearby hotel. Transit passengers quarantined for less than 24 hours will not be charged. Quarantine times of 24 hours or more will be invoiced to the traveler(s). Transit times of more than 72 hours require an Australian Border Force exemption.For Qatar Airways and Emirates, look for nonstop routes from Brisbane to Doha and Dubai, respectively (not routes that stop in Sydney first).Singapore Airlines is also operating regular commercial air service between Brisbane and Singapore and between Singapore and U.S. ports of entry. However, at present, U.S. citizens are advised not to use these routes, as Singapore Airlines may cancel reservations for any passenger that does not originate at certain approved ports.",All incoming travelers must undergo a 14 day quarantine at a government-designated hotel.

Zambia,"On March 18, 2020, the Zambian Minister of Health confirmed two cases of COVID-19 in Zambia.Any other relevant information. The government has announced increased screenings at airport and border entry points, instituted 14-day monitoring for persons at high risk of COVID-19, are increasing training for clinicians and health workers at select hospitals and are currently working to develop increased public information campaigns. With technical support from U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the first testing capabilities in Zambia were established in Lusaka on February 11, and another Lusaka-based lab opened on February 12 with Japanese government support.","Are there any new restrictions in place as a result of the worldwide outbreak? Zambia is not denying entry to any foreign nationals, regardless of nationality or place of origin.Do travelers need particular documentation to enter/exit? A passport and visa are required to enter Zambia. Passports must be valid for at least six months upon arrival and have at least three blank pages upon each entry. Travelers transiting other countries on the way to Zambia, particularly South Africa, should refer to their Country Information pages for additional blank page requirements.What procedures have been put in place at airports and other ports of entry? Zambia has implemented limited screening at the international airports in Lusaka, Livingstone and Ndola. The screening includes using no-touch thermometers (“thermo-scanners”) to check body temperature and asking travelers to complete a travel health questionnaire.","Include any relevant information about quarantine policies – if they are in effect – such as length of quarantine, location, etc. Travelers who have been in China in the past 14 days will be self-monitored for 14 days since their last potential exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 (typically the day they entered Zambia). These persons will be allowed to enter, and Zambian officials will call by phone daily to check for symptoms that indicate COVID-19. Such persons are encouraged to practice “social distancing” to limit the number of people they interact with while still in the incubation period for COVID-19 (i.e., 14 days). Persons with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 may be tested and/or quarantined.","['COVID-19 outbreak page on travel.state.gov: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/novel-coronavirus-hubei-province--china.html', 'CDC page on COVID-19: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china', 'https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Zambia.html: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Zambia.html', 'COVID-19 Fact Sheet Zambia: https://zm.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2019-nCoV_fact_sheet_Zambia.pdf', 'U.S. Embassy Zambia: https://zm.usembassy.gov/author/missionzm/', 'Alert: https://zm.usembassy.gov/category/alert/', 'Messages for U.S. Citizens: https://zm.usembassy.gov/category/messages-for-us-citizens/', 'U.S. Citizen Services: https://zm.usembassy.gov/category/us-citizen-services/', 'Coronavirus: https://zm.usembassy.gov/tag/coronavirus/', 'COVID-19: https://zm.usembassy.gov/tag/covid-19/', ': https://zm.usembassy.gov/health-alert-u-s-embassy-lusaka-zambia-july-30-2020/', 'Health Alert: U.S. Embassy Lusaka Zambia: https://zm.usembassy.gov/health-alert-u-s-embassy-lusaka-zambia-july-30-2020/', ': https://zm.usembassy.gov/health-alert-u-s-embassy-lusaka-zambia-18/', 'Health Alert: U.S. Embassy Lusaka Zambia: https://zm.usembassy.gov/health-alert-u-s-embassy-lusaka-zambia-18/']",,
